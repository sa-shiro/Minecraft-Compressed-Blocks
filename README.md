Note: Compressed Stone recipes dont work and this wont be fixed, because i need to setup a 1.14 workspace again. To fix this, simply replace `"tag"` with `"item"` in the corresponding json files inside `/compressedblocks/data/recipes` folder and compile it using `gradlew build`or the gradle task

To compile this project you need to manually install the forge 1.15.2 MDK or use my [Multi-project Setup](https://github.com/sa-shiro/MDK_1.15-multi_project)
